## :robot: Infinity Robot

This repository contains the code used for the UoM Hackathon 2020 which involved the development of an automatic seeding machine for remote farming. 

## :factory: Robot Structure
- A Rover was used to move around the farms
- A Robot arm was used for digging a hole and seeding.
- A Raspberry Pi was used to control the rover and arm.
- An Arduino Uno was used to operate the tip of the robot arm to dig and release seeds.

## :page_with_curl: Files
- arm.py : code for robot arm movements
- run.py : code for rover movements
- servomotor.py : arduino uno codes for seeding mechanism
- lib.py : default configurations for arm
- config.py : configurations for saving pictures of seeding process on Firebase

## :globe_with_meridians: Websites of Project and Hackathon

A [Website](https://infinity-robot.web.app/) created to detail the project and photos captured by rover can be visualised.

The rover can be triggered remotely using the "Define Parameters" function to set the length and width of the seeding tray.
